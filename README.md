### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi, Iâ€™m a formerly freelance full-stack developer from Berlin working for [@bitly](https://github.com/bitly) Europe ([@Egoditor](https://github.com/Egoditor)). Beforehand I was supporting agencies, businesses, and science projects with clean and fast performing [JavaScript](https://www.ephigenia.de/project/#JavaScript) & [PHP](https://www.ephigenia.de/project/#PHP) since 2001.

Whether itâ€™s back end or front end, apps or web-based services, consulting or coding â€“ I love to tackle complex challenges and always strive for a structured product.
