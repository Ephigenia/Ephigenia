### Hi there 👋

[Hi, I’m a Berlin-based full-stack developer at [Bitly](https://github.com/bitly), previously working as a freelance consultant for agencies, businesses, and research projects. I’ve been building clean, scalable web applications in [JavaScript](https://www.ephigenia.de/project/#javascript)/[TypeScript](https://www.ephigenia.de/project#typescript) and [PHP](([project/#PHP](https://www.ephigenia.de/project#PHP)) since 2001 — and today I also work with infrastructure as code and [Go](https://www.ephigenia.de/project/#go).

Whether it’s back end or front end, apps or web-based services, consulting or coding – I love to tackle complex challenges and always strive for a structured product.
